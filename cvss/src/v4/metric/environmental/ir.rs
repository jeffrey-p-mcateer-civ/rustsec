/// Integrity Requirements (IR) - CVSS v4.0 Environmental Metric Group
///
/// Described in CVSS v4.0 Specification: Section 4.1
///
/// > These metrics enable the consumer to customize the assessment depending on
/// > the importance of the affected IT asset to the analyst’s organization,
/// > measured in terms of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. That
/// > is, if an IT asset supports a business function for which Availability is
/// > most important, the analyst can assign a greater value to Availability
/// > metrics relative to Confidentiality and Integrity. Each Security
/// > Requirement has three possible values: Low, Medium, or High, or the
/// > default value of Not Defined (X).
/// >
/// > The full effect on the environmental score is determined by the
/// > corresponding Modified Base Impact metrics. Following the concept of
/// > assuming “reasonable worst case”, in absence of explicit values, these
/// > metrics are set to the default value of Not Defined (X), which is
/// > equivalent to the metric value of High (H).
