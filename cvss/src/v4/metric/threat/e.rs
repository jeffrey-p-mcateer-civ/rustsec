/// Exploit Maturity (E) - CVSS v4.0 Threat Metric Group
///
/// Described in CVSS v4.0 Specification: Section 3.1
///
/// > This metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked,
/// > and is based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code
/// > availability, or active, “in-the-wild” exploitation. Public availability
/// > of easy-to-use exploit code or exploitation instructions increases the
/// > number of potential attackers by including those who are unskilled.
/// > Initially, real-world exploitation may only be theoretical. Publication of
/// > proof-of-concept exploit code, functional exploit code, or sufficient
/// > technical details necessary to exploit the vulnerability may follow.
/// > Furthermore, the available exploit code or instructions may progress from
/// > a proof-of-concept demonstration to exploit code that is successful in
/// > exploiting the vulnerability consistently. In severe cases, it may be
/// > delivered as the payload of a network-based worm or virus or other
/// > automated attack tools.
///
/// > It is the responsibility of the CVSS consumer to populate the values of
/// > Exploit Maturity (E) based on information regarding the availability of
/// > exploitation code/processes and the state of exploitation techniques. This
/// > information will be referred to as “threat intelligence” throughout this
/// > document.
///
/// > Operational Recommendation: Threat intelligence sources that provide
/// > Exploit Maturity information for all vulnerabilities should be preferred
/// > over those with only partial coverage. Also, it is recommended to use
/// > multiple sources of threat intelligence as many are not comprehensive.
/// > This information should be updated as frequently as possible and its
/// > application to CVSS assessment should be automated.
