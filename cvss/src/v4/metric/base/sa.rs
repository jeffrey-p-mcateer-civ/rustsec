/// Availability Impact to the Subsequent System (SA) - CVSS v4.0 Base Metric
/// Group
///
/// Described in CVSS v4.0 Specification: Section 2.2.8
///
/// > This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted system
/// > resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the
/// > Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of
/// > confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by
/// > the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted
/// > system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email).
/// > Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources,
/// > attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space
/// > all impact the availability of a system. The resulting score is greatest
/// > when the consequence to the system is highest.
