/// > conditions or variables** of the vulnerable system that enable the attack.
/// > These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref _Attack
/// > Complexity_) as the primary purpose of these conditions is **not** to
/// > explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence
/// > of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system. If the attacker
/// > does not take action to overcome these conditions, the attack may succeed
/// > only occasionally or not succeed at all.
