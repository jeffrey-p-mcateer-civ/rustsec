/// Attack Vector (AV) - CVSS v4.0 Base Metric Group
///
/// Described in CVSS v4.0 Specification: Section 2.1.1
///
/// > This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is
/// > possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will
/// > be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be
/// > in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the
/// > number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited
/// > from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers
/// > that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device,
/// > and therefore warrants a greater severity.

    /// > (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another

    /// > The vulnerable system is bound to a protocol stack, but the attack is
    /// > limited at the protocol level to a logically adjacent topology. This
    /// > can mean an attack must be launched from the same shared proximity
    /// > (e.g., Bluetooth, NFC, or IEEE 802.11) or logical network (e.g., local
    /// > IP subnet), or from within a secure or otherwise limited
    /// > administrative domain (e.g., MPLS, secure VPN within an administrative
    /// > network zone). One example of an Adjacent attack would be an ARP
    /// > (IPv4) or neighbor discovery (IPv6) flood leading to a denial of
    /// > service on the local LAN segment (e.g., CVE-2013-6014).

    /// > The vulnerable system is bound to the network stack and the set of
    /// > possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up
    /// > to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often
    /// > termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being
    /// > exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g.,
    /// > across one or more routers). An example of a network attack is an
    /// > attacker causing a denial of service (DoS) by sending a specially
    /// > crafted TCP packet across a wide area network (e.g., CVE-2004-0230).
