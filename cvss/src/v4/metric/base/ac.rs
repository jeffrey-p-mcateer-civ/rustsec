/// Attack Complexity (AC) - CVSS v4.0 Base Metric Group
///
/// Described in CVSS v4.0 Specification: Section 2.1.2
///
/// > This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker
/// > to actively evade or circumvent **existing built-in security-enhancing
/// > conditions** in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions
/// > whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit
/// > engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a
/// > target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that
/// > would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture
/// > security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system, and does not relate
/// > to the amount of time or attempts it would take for an attacker to
/// > succeed, e.g. a race condition. If the attacker does not take action to
/// > overcome these conditions, the attack will always fail.
/// >
/// > The evasion or satisfaction of authentication mechanisms or requisites is
/// > included in the Privileges Required assessment and is *not* considered
/// > here as a factor of relevance for Attack Complexity.
